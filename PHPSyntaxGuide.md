## PHP Comments
Comments help make your code more readable and describe what is going on within the PHP. Comments are ignored by the PHP engine.

```
// single line comment
# single line comment
/* multi-line comment */
```

## PHP Variables
Variables begin with '$' and are used to store data

```
$var = "My variable";
```

**It's important to note that variable names are case sensitive. $var is not the same are $Var**
### A few more rules:
* No spaces can be used
* Only alpha-numeric characters and underscores can be used (0-9, a-z & _)
* Variable names must begin with a letter or underscore, not a number
